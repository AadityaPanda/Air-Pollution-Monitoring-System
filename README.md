# Air Pollution Monitoring System
The Air pollution monitoring system is a facility to measure air pollutants using sensors, processing using microcontrollers, and showing results using various displays.

## How can air pollution be monitored?
Air quality is a measure of how clean or polluted the air is. Air pollution is usually measured as Air Quality Index (AQI) in the PPM unit.

The sensors are most suitable for identifying hotspots at roadsides and near point sources. This sensor gets data that can be continuously monitored via different displays.
